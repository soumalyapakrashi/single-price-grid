## Overview

### The challenge

A pricing component design is given. We have to implement it in such a way so that users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- React


### What I learned

This is my first React project. So, I learned a lot about React. How to structure code, how to break up designs into different components are some of the topics.

Among CSS, I learned about Grid layout, the *vertical-align* property and media queries.
